                %p Ulrich studied Business at Rotterdam School of Management, one of Europe's Top Business Schools but quickly opted for the exciting tech start up scene as opposed to the usual corporate ladder. He applies the power of German "Genauigkeit" to all of his Rails and AngularJS projects and when he isn't at his desk, you might meet him hitch-hiking through Morocco, strolling through the rainforests of French Guyana or trying to pick up some Mazateco in Southern Mexico.
